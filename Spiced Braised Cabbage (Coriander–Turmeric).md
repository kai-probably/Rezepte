## Method

1. **Prepare the cabbage**  
   Cut **1 green cabbage** in half, remove the core, and slice finely into shreds.

2. **Soften the onion**  
   Heat **2–3 tbsp neutral oil** in a wide pan over medium heat.  
   Add **1 sliced onion** and **½ tsp of the salt**.  
   Cook until soft and translucent, without browning.

3. **Add garlic**  
   Add **3–4 sliced garlic cloves**.  
   Stir and cook briefly until fragrant (about 30 seconds).

4. **Add cabbage and spices**  
   Add the shredded **cabbage** to the pan.  
   Sprinkle over **2 tsp ground coriander** and **½–1 tsp ground turmeric**.  
   Toss until evenly coated.

5. **Add moisture**  
   Add **50–100 ml water**, just enough to create steam and prevent sticking.

6. **Add chillies**  
   Add **1–2 green chillies**, slit lengthwise.  
   Stir once to distribute.

7. **Braise**  
   Cover with a lid and cook on **low heat for ~20 minutes**.  
   Stir occasionally.  
   The cabbage should collapse, soften fully, and turn glossy yellow.

8. **Finish**  
   Taste and adjust with remaining **salt** if needed.  
   Stir through **fresh coriander** just before serving.
