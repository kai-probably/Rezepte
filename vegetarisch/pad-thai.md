#### Ingredients for 2

* 226.8 g flat rice noodles
* 41 g oil
* 3 cloves garlic , minced
* 226.8 g uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces&#x20;
* 2 eggs
* 104 g fresh bean sprouts
* 1 red bell pepper , thinly sliced
* 3 green onions , chopped
* 75 g dry roasted peanuts
* 2 limes
* 8 g Fresh cilantro , chopped

**For the Pad Thai sauce:**

* 45 g fish sauce
* 17 g low-sodium soy sauce
* 63 g light brown sugar
* 29 g rice vinegar , or Tamarind Paste\*
* 19 g Sriracha hot sauce , or more, to taste
* 30 g creamy peanut butter\* (optional)

#### Instructions

* **Cook noodles** according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.
* **Make sauce** by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.&#x20;
* **Stir Fry::** Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.
* Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.
* Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.
* **Garnish** the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!
* Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.

#### Notes

**Make Ahead Instructions:** Cut your protein, and chop veggies ahead of time. Stir sauce ingredients together and refrigerate until ready to use.**Tamarind Paste:** Substitute 2 Tablespoons Tamarind paste in place of the vinegar, for a more authentic sauce. You can buy tamarind online, or at an international foods market. **Vegan or Vegetarian:** Leave out the egg. Use tofu, and substitute the fish sauce for more soy sauce.**Peanut Butter:** In my recipe, I add a big scoop of peanut butter to the sauce because I think it gives the whole dish an added creaminess and boost of flavor.
